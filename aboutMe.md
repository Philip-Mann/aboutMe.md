# Hey y'all, I am Philip Mann.

## I have been driving trucks over the road for the last 7 years. I have driven in 43 of the 50 states and 4 of the 5 major provinces in Canada during my time on the road. I have also had the pleasure of backpacking Germany and Thailand the year before covid. I have met a lot of interesting and unique people on my travels and never fail to make friends. 

## My main goal is to get outside my comfort zone, learn new skills, and be a successful developer.

### What do I do in my sparetime?

- I really enjoy cooking and love making everything from scratch. My specialty is smash burgers and breakfast tacos.
- If you couldn't tell already I really enjoy traveling and roadtrips. For work or for fun, I enjoy it all the time. 
- I love spending time with my girlfriend Taylor and our dog [**Ozzy**](https://imgur.com/xynMC6v).
